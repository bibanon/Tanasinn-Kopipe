== Aikido ==
I believe you shouldn't underestimate Aikido. Now I know you may be thinking, "Why take a weakling martial art like Aikido seriously when I am learning Kendo?" I can see why you would think that, how can a peaceful martial arts like Aikido beat a powerful one like Kendo?

Well, I have a story to share with you.

Years ago, I was a Kendoka, I thought I was the toughest kid in high school, I would pick fights, and kick ass. I was full of hate, until I picked a fight with the wrong dude. He was a Japanese exchange student, I still remember his name, Noboru Takeda.

I picked on him because of his hilarious and thick Japanese accent. I told him I was going to beat him so hard, he would go back to China(Yeah, I was a little racist prick.), he never said anything back, made me wanted to kick his ass even harder.

Well, here comes the fight. I threw men and do strikes, he dodged them like I was a mere white belt. I was tiring out and he knew, I saw the smirk on his face that made me raged hard. I put all my strength in one amazing tsuki, and he grabbed past it to my wrist and threw me over. My back smacked on the hard cement ground, and I was knocked out for who knows how long.

When I woke up I was in the school infirmary, I asked the nurse who brought me here, and you guessed it, Noboru Takeda. The next day, he wasn't at school, he was back in Japan, and I never got to thank him, for saving my life and showing me the light. I soon learned that he was an Aikidoka and have been practicing Aikido ever since to show my thanks to him. 

=== ===
I have defeated countless opponents using Aikido, and they always ask me, Why are you so strong?

I answer, I'm not strong, you are.

Aikido uses the strength of the attacker back at them but 10 times stronger(estimate). Using Aikido and I can probably kill a charging Rhino using it's force right back at it, of course, I'm not going to try it, way to dangerous for any sane person.

I recommend practicing Aikido for every /jp/edo, as you are all physically weak, and Aikido is specialized for the weak to defend against the strong.

A 50 year old man with cerebral palsy doing Aikido, very touching. 

=== ===
Arguably the most powerful martial arts in Japan.

An Aikido practitioner is practically invincible, no one of any martial arts background can ever land a punch or kick on one.

Using the power of the attacker, the Aikido practitioner uses absolutely no energy to knock them down.

A fearsome martial arts it is. 

== A Misunderstood Man ==
Shinji...I don't get why he gets all the hate on /a/. FSN is just written to make him out as the bad guy, when really he's no worse than any of the 'protagonists' and a better person than most of them.

What are the main complaints? He raped Sakura and stole Rider to use in the war?

Okay, let's get this straight. He never fucking raped Sakura. He never did it. He never did it. He never did it. He never did it. He fucked Sakura.

Let me ask you this. WHO IN THE GAME DIDN'T FUCK SAKURA? You can't even name one fucking character who hasn't plugged her loose cunt! She is the kind of bitch who will act like she doesn't want it when she really does. She'll say No! while having multiple orgasms. Shinji knew this, he's a fucking ladies man. He knows what filthy whores like Sakura want.

And there's this other big bitch you guys have with him. He supposedly stole Rider and used her in the war for his own greed.

Objection! He was worried about his one and only precious sister. Is keeping your loved ones from a brutal war so wrong? When Shirou does the same thing to Saber it's like 'oh he's so manly', but when Shinji does it it's wrong? He just wanted to protect Sakura. He probably was going to use his Holy Grail wish to tighten her cunt back up or cure her syphilis or something.

The story was written to make that faggot Shirou look good. Objectively, Shinji is a far better character than Shirou. At least he has the balls to take action decisively instead of dicking around like Shirou, and if he weren't stuck with the weak ass servant Rider and no plothax he probably would have won the war.

=== Japan ===
Japan...I don't get why she gets all the hate on /jp/. World War II is just written to make her out as the bad guy, when really she's no worse than any of the 'protagonists' and a better country than most of them.

What are the main complaints? She raped China and stole Southeast Asia to use in the war?

Okay, let's get this straight. She never fucking raped China. She never did it. She never did it. She never did it. She never did it. She fucked China.

Let me ask you this. WHO IN THE WORLD DIDN'T FUCK CHINA? You can't even name one fucking nation who hasn't flooded her loose ports! She is the kind of bitch who will act like she doesn't want it when she really does. She'll say No! while signing multiple treaties. Japan knew this, she's a fucking ladies man. She knows what filthy whores like China want.

And there's this other big bitch you guys have with her. She supposedly stole Southeast Asia and used her in the war for her own greed.

Objection! She was worried about her one and only precious Brother-Asians. Is keeping your loved ones from a brutal imperialism so wrong? When America does the same thing to the Phillipines it's like 'oh she's so manly', but when Japan does it it's wrong? She just wanted to protect Asia. She probably was going to use her superpower status to tighten her ports back up or cure her malaria or something.

The history was written to make that faggot America look good. Objectively, Japan is a far better country than America. At least she has the balls to take action decisively instead of dicking around like America, and if she wasn't stuck with the weak ass colony Corea and no plothax she probably would have won the war.

What are the main complaints? She was all "supporting" her sister in trying to get with Tomoya, but as soon as she thought he was after her she was all ready to spread her bowling pins for him? And then cried pathetically when she didn't get the cock herself?

Okay, let's get this straight. She fucking spread her legs open. She did it. She did it. She did it. She did it. She wanted Tomoya to plug her loose cunt.

Let me ask you this. WHO IN THE GAME DIDN'T WANT TO GET FUCKED BY TOMOYA? You can't even name one fucking character who didn’t want to get plugged by his huge dick! He is the kind of pimp who will act like he doesn't want it when he really does. He'll say No! while having multiple orgasms. Kyou knew this, she's a fucking slut in sheep’s clothing. She knows what awesome pimps like Tomoya want.

And there's this other big bitch you guys have with her. She supposedly cried pathetically when she didn't get the cock herself.

Objection! She was just pathetic like her one and only precious sister. Is crying over heartache so wrong? When Ryou does the same thing over Kappei it's like 'oh I want to hug and comfort her', but when Kyou does it it's wrong? She just wanted to release all her pent up feelings. She probably was going to become a teacher to tighten the children’s morality up so they won’t end up as sluts like her and spread AIDS or something.

The story was written to make that whore Kyou look good. Objectively, Ryou is a far better character than Kyou. At least she has the balls to take action decisively instead of dicking around like Kyou, and if she weren't stuck with that weak ass personality and no plothax she probably could have fucked the entire cast.

She knows what filthy whores like Marisa want.

And there's this other big bitch you guys have with her. She supposedly used Alice to get closer to Marisa.

Objection! She was worried about her one and only precious witch. Is keeping your loved ones from heartache so wrong? When Sakuya does the same thing to Meiling it's like 'oh she's so sexy', but when Reimu does it it's wrong? She just wanted to protect Marisa. She probably was going to study magic to tighten Gensokyo's borders back up or cure Patchouli's asthma or something.

The story was written to make that faggot Sakuya look good. Objectively, Reimu is a far better character than Sakuya. At least she has the balls to take action decisively instead of dicking around like Sakuya, and if she weren't stuck with that lazy ass personality and invincible plothax she probably could have killed the entire cast. I mean, fucked.

== Apples and Milk: The Emily Connor Saga ==

Apples and Milk: The Emily Connor Saga.

Hello, my name is Toshiro Fujiwara, I live in Tokyo. I have for you a very interesting story.

I was at the airport wishing my mother and sister safe travel to Hawaii. I stood at the departure gates and watched as they dissapeared into the growing crowds of people. I turned to leave and saw a nervous white girl standing, looking around like she had lost track of someone. I am nice so I approached her and asked what was wrong in my best english. "Hello, you are lost yes?".

She almost laughed, "Yeah, sorta, I think my Taxi never showed up, I've been here for an hour!" I paused. "Hmm, I can give you ride, madam" I stuttered. I was not very threatening, a small skinny Jap wou could be overpowered by the elderly, I dont think she felt threatened by me saying this.

"Sure, oh, I speak Japanese". She contorted her face into a smile.

I then started to speak to her in Japanese as I led her to the parking lot. "Where are you from?" I asked. She replied "USA, Florida". I knew not of where Florida was, but it sounded mysterious and foreign to me. "Do you have a place to stay?" I then asked.

"No, not yet." She replied. "My name is Emily". "Emiry" I thought, a pretty name.

I mentioned that my father owned a big hotel in Tokyo, and offered to take her there. She accepted, and I opened my car doors with the key. "Put the bags in the back, there is a very big trunk!". She began to hoist the suitcases into the trunk. "I wish I had some junk in my trunk." I didnt know what to say to that. "Uh, small buts are fine too". She blushed and giggled. As we got in the car she sat down in the passenger side and immediately let out a huge yawn. "Tired?" I asked. She nodded and closed her eyes. I took the time to glance at her supple breasts. B cup I would estimate, that's large for Japan.

I started the engine and off we went to the hotel.

We were in front of the hotel, in a VIP parking spot. It was not nighttime. She was asleep. "Wake up!" I yelled quietly. She didnt wake, so I moved my hand over to touch her shoulder. She jumped, and grabbed my hand with both arms. It was an awkward moment, I felt her warm hands grasping my cold wrists. She slid her hands slightly down my arm, and I almost felt a sensation in my penis. She let go. "Sorry..." she said solemnly. I nodded. We both opened the doors and went to the trunk to grab the luggage.

She hoisted her big briefcase over her back, and bent down to carry it up the stairs. I followed with a smaller package. I watched her butt up ahead, it was so fine. I knew I needed to get her in bed.

I saw my brother at the reception desk. I waved and he pointed at the girl. "Oh, she is a friend from USA, needs a room." My brother smiled. "The upper suite is vacant now, that fat Canadian guy left this morning, it's been cleaned." She continued to the elevator and I looked back at my brother. He winked, and I winked back.

We finally made it to the 80th floor where the suite was. There was a beautiful view of Tokyo here, I had never appreciated the view at night. "Wow... it's romantic hehe" she giggled as she dropped her suitcase. I shut the door and we both walked over to the huge windows to admire the city. "Yup, this is where I live" I said. I couldnt take the tension any longer. I put my arm over her shoulder, and she giggled and blushed. "I thought I'd have to ask for stuff like this" she said. "Nah, it's mutual." I looked into her eyes. She dove into my face and began to furiously kiss my. I felt my dick filling up. I slowly manuevered her to the bed, and pushed her down. I pulled my T-shirt off, and she took off hers. I tried to get on top of her but she then pushed me off to the side, then leapt on top. "I like it here better" she giggled as she straddled me. I felt her warmth across my midsection as she undid her bra. She pulled my pants off, and then hers. My raging boner stuck through my boxers as she took off her panties. Slowly she mounted my dick, I felt the warmth blanketing my dick. Up, down, up, down, in, out, in, out...

Then there was a knock at the door, and it opened. "Where the Yanqui girl at?" Someone shouted. It was my father.

We both froze, and I saw him come into view. He stood staring at us, but then began to unbutton his shirt. "If your mother is away, a Yanqui is fine too." He bellowed. Emiry started to blush and my father pounced on the bed like an animal. "My son, you have seen me naked many time before, do not be ashamed, we both seek pleasure. Emily seemed uncomfortable as my father grabbed her waist. In one move he drove his cock into her butt and Emiry grimaced and put her head down. I was worried, but then she put her head back up and I saw she was smiling again. "That was pretty intense" she remaked with a giggle, and my father started thrusting. I then took the other end and put my cock in her mouth. Back and forth we pushed her like a two handed saw.

Then the door opened again, now with lots of footsteps. My father smiled, but I was nervious.

I then saw that it was my brother, and he had brought about 10 of his friends froms school. They were visibly drunk and louder than I've ever heard them. Emiry looked shocked but my father and I continued to push her between us. My brother and his friends were hopping around, quickly taking off all their clothes. When they were butt naked they leaped on the bed until it was covered with bodies. Those who could not get a footing on the bed stood around. They all started furiously masterbating, to the point where it was very noisy with the sound of lotioned stroking. Emiry started to sqeal. Her body was getting tight. We contintued to thrust back and forth until her entire body spasmed and she let out a muffled scream of pleasure. I then cummed down her throat, and she stood back from my dick and looked at the ceiling licking her lips. Within seconds my brothers friends had all came to climax, and they shot their juice all over her face and chest. She was thourghly frosted from the waist up in cum, as more began to splash on her like a sprinkler. She tried to wipe her eyes clear of the layers of milky semen, but my father grabbed her arms, came around in front of her and delivered the final squirt right between the eyes. She fell over backwards on the bed and we all stood around the bed looking at her, giggling.

"Welcome" said my father. "Welcome, to Japan". 

==Bento box==

Im looking for a bento box, it cant be pinku (thats japanese for pink) or any girl color. It has to be of 2 or more kotoba (thats japanese for 2 compartments) and has be be chibi (small) sized. And has to be really kawaii (cute). Also It has to be about 10-20 bux. And you have to post pics of it first (i want to make shure it's kawaii [cute]). And it would be nice if it came with matching chopstick holder (WITH chopsticks). OH! and it CANNOT have any cartoon pictures, or be made out of plastic. It has to be made of ceramic, or something like that. Also it would be nice if it was made in japan. and not in china or corea (korea) or whatever. I have found a bento box similar to the one im describing in e-bay, but it was 1 kotoba, and i dont want my gohan (rice) to touch my other things (it can get wet and i would not like that, plus 2 compartments looks more kawaii)

=== cool story ==
Hi! My name is Sakuya and I want to tell you a story!

I joined Alice, Reimu and Marisa on their adventure to [[Japan]]! We all wanted to see what a [[dick]] looked like because we had never seen one. We heard they were very hard, so we had some pads to protect us.

We all got into a small, poorly made, Japanese vehicle and started to drive downtown. We saw a weird midget and a really big faggot! It almost yelled at us, but Reimu made the car move faster. Whew, that was close! We passed by a bar full of gay men. It was very FABULOUS!

After we made it to [[Akihabara]] , Reimu spotted a penis. It was very big and hard, just like our friends said. Good thing we had lots of condoms with us! The penis swarmed right at us and he penetrated our vaginas! I was sure we were done for, but then Marisa said she would go talk to the dick.

"Hi there Mr. Dick. You penetrated our vaginas! Why would you do such a thing?"

The prick didn't want to talk to Marisa. He [[Rape|raped]] her, and it looked like he was going to cum in her! But never fear, because Alice, Reimu and I went out to save her! We brought some condoms with us. They threw the condoms at the penis, and it started to throb. It let go of Marisa, and we all got back into the car. When I told my friends at Scarlet Devil Mansion what happened, they didn't believe me.

"You're lying, Sakuya! There is no dick big enough to do that! I'll go down and see it for myself!"

But that's ANOTHER story! The end.

== DEATH TO ALL JAPANESE WORDS ==

I'm gonna go down to the [vinegared rice topped with raw fish] bar and have some [rice wine]. Afterwards maybe I'll do some [singing along to instrumental versions of popular songs]. I can't stay out too late though, because I have a [empty handed martial arts] lesson in the morning. Maybe later I'll play some [Clump of Souls] on PS2. The Prince sure loves rolling that [clump] around. In the end, I'll probably just end up posting some [perverted fan comics] on the [perversion] board of Four Channel. 

== Genesis ==
In the beginning, heaven and earth were not divided. Then, from the ocean of chaos, a reed arose, and that was the eternal land ruler, Kunitokotatchi.

Then came the female God, Izanami, and the male, Izanagi.

They looked down into the chaos and said, "Is that not land?"

Then Izanagi THRUST HIS HUGE BURNING MANLY SPEAR INTO THE CHAOS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.
THE CHAOS BLED WHERE HE HAD PIERCED IT WITH HIS MANLY WEAPON.

HARDER AND HARDER IZANAGI POUNDED THE CHAOS SEA, IZAMANI LOOKING ON IN ABJECT INTEREST AT HIS FIERCE AND DOMINANT STATURE.

FINALLY, THE CHAOS AND INZANAGI SHUDDERED, INANAGI WITHDRAWING HIS SPEAR DRIPPING FROM THE CHAOS'S FLUIDITY. *drip drip drip*

From there, the drops became the island of Japan. Therefore, >>5244945

Nobody's gonna sit 5 years in his room and polish a branding iron, exept you maybe because you can't get any pussy.
<br>Now, you're telling me that you know stuff about cowboy code. HA HA FUCKING HA FAGGOT. You couldn'T even get a proper 10 gallon hat if your life depended on it, not like it's worth anything. <br>No fucking one wears a goddamn cowboy outfit in the streets, you retarded fuckwit.
<br>Go on, move to America, get laughed at by fucking everyone, I might just fly with you to have a seat in the front row when your spirit is shattered to a thousand bits. No one is gonna like an acne-ridden wannabe-american who doesn't know shit about the culture he so disgustingly admires.

== Kara no Kyokai ==
The Kara no Kyoukai BD box set will be released for $400.

"What, indeed, is money?" I asked.

She flipped her long auburn hair with the casual elegance of a spider walking among snakes, and began to speak.

"Currency is a system that man has devised in order to give his efforts-- which you and I understand are ultimately meaningless on the astral scale, but the thrashing of a fly whose legs have yet to be torn off--"

(I recalled that like the dinosaurs, humanity would eventually be destroyed by some mundane natural occurrence like a meteor: we were too insiginificant for gods to take notice of.)

"--value. The ''wealth number'', such as it is, can be increased by work and decreased in exchange for goods and services, like our morning tea and the maid who brings it to us."

And indeed, the frills she wore. I understood this concept. It was like the use of male reproductive liquids in the magical world. In a corner of my mind, I began a series of calculations that would eventually result in my magical ''wealth number''.

"A box set of the Japanese animated feature film series ''Kara no Kyoukai'' on Blu-Ray Disc will cost the big brothers in America four hundred of their dollar-bills. Each film would cost fifty of these strange paper strips."

This is more than the typical American big brother pays for a motion picture recorded onto any sort of discus, and many are concerned that there will be no papers left for them to ward off demons with. In Japan, 100,000 big brothers paid even more yen-coins for their discs, but as they view the discs less as a practical item than as religious offerings of an odd sort, they are pleased."

I'd made up my mind. I had to ask her.

"Sis--"

"Yes, simpleton?"

A hint of joy was mixed with her disdain.

"I want to buy Kara no Kyoukai. Is there a way to exchange my semen for some of these dollar-bills?"

She paused, blushing.

"That is possible."

== Ken-Sama ==
Gomenasai, my name is Ken-Sama.

I'm a 27 year old American Otaku. I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, God Hand)

I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.

I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%

When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer for Square Enix!

I own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.

Wish me luck in Japan!

== Kobayashi Sushi ==
"I LOVE SUSHI!" exclaimed the woman in the thick-rimmed glasses.
<br>"Ah, excellent," Kobayashi thought contentedly to himself, "they are enjoying themselves."
<br>"I love Japan, period" said the middle-aged man in the blue shirt, slight southern drawl lending a down-home earthiness to his earnest proclamation.
<br>"Oh my, it is such a joy to have such enthusiastic customers!" Kobayashi said to himself, beaming with pride at the delight he had brought to his customers. It was an idyllic day in Kobayashi's small sushi shop. But, then things took a turn for the worst. "J-ROCK!" screeched a greasy-haired delinquent, quite obviously high on something.
<br>"Oh my, someone should be watching over that poor child," Kobayashi thought to himself. But, before he could finish that thought, a rotund man burst forth from the masses, the make-up on his face still smeared across his fleshy visage.
<br>"GIRUGAMESH!" the horrifying painted man exclaims, stabbing the air vehemtly with two massive, pudgy digits.

<br>"What has begun here is something terrible," Kobayashi thinks to himself, rooted in place by equal parts fear, and morbid fascination.
<br>"I LOVE ANIME!" shrieks a curiously toupee'd customer, the disparity of voice and adornment calling into question the beast's gender. "AND MANGA" yells the man-lady's back-quatto, the horrifying extra upper torso protruding from the hermaphrodite's back, malign intent dancing across his/her eyes. Kobayashi is speechless at the spectacle unfolding before him.
<br>"AND GAYMEN!" an infernal scarecrow man drunkenly spews forth, every diabolical syllable dripping from his tongue an affront to sanity and dignity.

<br>"Uh...DDR?," says a man quite plainly.
<br>"Finally, a respite from this madness," Kobayashi thought as he heaved a breathless sigh of relief. But what he had seen so far could never prepare him for what came next.
<br>"SMILE D.K." squealed the man's bloated pig-wife, barely managing to stay balanced atop her chair. 

As these things happened, a realization dawned on poor, poor Kobayashi. "These people, these DEMONS, have taken all I know and love and made it wrong, corrupted it. I can not, no, I will not sit idly by as these creatures from beyond the veil wreak havoc in my shop!"

"HEYYYYYY!" Kobayashi growls, brandishing his knife like a modern day warrior. "SAKURA-CON HE IKIMAAAAAAAAAASU" he bellows, the traditional war-cry of his family. As Kobayashi leapt over the table, the gathered masses began morphing, face tearing asunder to reveal rows upon rows of sharp teeth, as new musculature rippled forth from beneath their clothes. Many dropped to all fours, revealing their true bestial nature, snarling and snapping their jaws at Kobayashi. Like a true warrior, however, he dove fearlessly into the throes of battle, slicing sinew and bone alike with a precision afforded him by his years of chef training. He laughed maniacally as bucket upon bucket of blood was spilled, the organs and flesh of his former patrons spewing forth like water down a hill. He and his restaurant alike were soon strewn with every type of viscera, and he gave an animalistic howl to the still-rising moon.

Kobayashi goose-stepped over the knee-high pile of cadavers, and, having finally exited the restaurant, he wiped the blood clean from his cleaver and strode off into the horizon. He knew that he had honored his ancestors with this true act of bravery, and helped to rid the world of a grave evil indeed. 

== Really, Really Average ==
Finished Saya no Uta. And it was really, really average.

95% of the cast was completely unlike-able, the exceptions being Saya herself and Kouji. The plot wasn't all that good, though it did have it's moments. The resolution was either extremely stupid or doesn't resolve much at all, depending on which you take.

That said, I didn't hate it. It was interesting enough to keep me reading, but it never wowed me or made me experience any emotion at all, for that matter. The sad moments never effected me, and the 'intense' moments made me go ''meh''. Everything is pretty much forgettable.

Can somebody explain me why people hyped it so much? Because there's absolutely nothing special about it. 

== SUPERIOR ==
[[Image:SUPERIOR.jpg|200px|right]]
For 23 years and 11 months had I suffered them, the ignorant ''gaijin'' back home who sickened me with their microwaved culture and their materialism. The spindly losers in the anime club who cared only for anime and not a whit for the superior monoethnic culture to which it was endemic. Well no more. Fucking ''zettai'' no more. I touched down in the country I was certain I had lived all my previous lives, no doubt as a badass ''ronin samurai ninja'' or some shit. I had never been here, but I had returned.

''Nippon-sama, tadaima''!

No sooner had I left the airport when I saw the woman of my dreams. She confirmed my every hope, my every ideal of this great land. The light coming in through the ''sakura'' backlit her like a full body halo. She was made of demure and soft spoken. Of bowing and ''bento''.

Of Japan and perfect.

My heart started ''doki doki''-ing all over the shop. And then she saw me! Spotted me in the crowd! Well, of course she did, I was like a head taller than the fucking hobbits they call men around here. I was in no state of mind to meet her gaze, and tried to look away but I was paralysed. She was just so ... ''prettyu'' ...

And just like that she started walking over. Her walk was just pure concentrated sex. If you poured a glass of it sex fumes would just rise right off the top. I loved the way the light danced unevenly over her pristine porcelain skin as she walked. The way she did more for me by showing just her shoulders than any American girls could by showing their entire gaping cleavage for all the world to SEE THIS YOU SHOULD TAKE NOTES, THIS IS WHAT ''SEXY'' IS YOU FUCKING ''WHORES'' -

"おげようごります"。<BR>
Oh shit, what did she say? She said something! To me! But I wasn't con –<BR>
"おげんきですか"。<BR>
OK, OK, I know this one. Where have I heard it before? Naruto 43? Oh god she's so hot –<BR>
"わたしのなまえは かお です"。<BR>
Fuck, I couldn't find the right words. Was it ''oro''? Was it ''dattebayo''? Was it ''anata baka''?!?<BR>
"おなまえはなんすか"。<BR>
You know what, it doesn't even matter! Her voice sounds as good as she looks. I don't need to say anything. I could do this forever. This is goddamn bliss.<BR>
"..."

She suddenly seemed apprehensive, like she was cautious of what she wanted to say next. ''Loveu loveu'' confession ''desu''?!<BR>
"Yes, what is it?" I blurted out.<BR>
"OH HEY MAN YOU SPEAKING ENGLISH?" <BR>
"What?" What?<BR>
"OH YEAH YOU DOES HAY NICE I LIKE."<BR>
No. NO! This was not coming from her mouth. It couldn't be.<BR>
"OH HAY YOU FROM AMERICA I LIKE. SO COOL! FUCK!"<BR>
no no no no no no<BR>
"I LOVE ALL AMERICA MOVIE AND SERIE. OH HAY DO YOU WATCH FRIENDS YES. ROSS AND RACHEL. COOL!"<BR>
"Um ... pleasu speaku Japanesu."<BR>
"NO ENGLISH MUCH BETTER I LEARN MANY YEAR AND COLOUR HAIR TO LOOK LIKE HILLARY DUFF. SO CUTE! FUCK!"<BR>
"I CAN SPEAK JAPANESEU SO ONEGAI PLEASE SPEAK JAPANESE TO WATASHI!"<BR>
"MORE INTENSITY LOGER MOORE RIP MY STOCKINGS RIP MY STOCKINGS LOL" 

== Stones ==
Once, not too long ago, in a sleepy, forgotten island in a distant sea, there was a village. This village worshipped strange idols, disembodied heads of non-eulcidian geometry from which one could sometimes hear fearful sounds, cries both human and not, of distress, agony and rapture, and from which a mysterous eldritch power could be felt. A wind constantly flew from these idols, as if the air itself feared their presence and tried futilely to escape, a wind of madness that carried with it the minds of all men and women foolish enough to live near them in an unending frenzy of terror and madness. All of them, that is, except for a single old man, who spent his life sitting at the base of the idols, and laughed. At others, he laughed, as if their very existance was nothing but a joke. At all things, he laughed, as if there was nothing in this world but a gigantic farce. At himself, he laughed, as if his own existance was the punchline. Certainly he himself was mad, a madness so deep it developped into a deranged sanity none could understand.

There one day came a young man, full of knowledge and confidence, who came across the madman, and the madman's laughter grew stronger than it ever had. Nettled, the young man spoke.

"And what, pray tell, amuses you so? What do you see that I do not, that I know not? What could someone like you have to teach me?"

The old man's cachinnation only grew stronger. As the young man was about to dismiss him as a madman, he finally spoke, calming his guffaws.

"What could an old man like me have to teach you, indeed? A man such as you could not possibly learn anything from me, yet I will and I must try, for you will not understand."

"Then speak, elder, and I will keep an open mind."

And the old man laughed. 

"Then listen, young ignorant, and know the truth of the universe, and of the infinite power of the Head Gods. At the top of the world stands the 9, the idiot savant who guides all things. None but the mad and the unthinking can understand this being, for its mind is unfathomable and inhuman. It, perhaps, does not even register than anything exists beyond its simple world. Acting as its messenger is the angel with a thousand eyes, who shifts all things on her wings of obsidian and leads all to death and insanity for her own amusement, and overlooking everything is the Devil of the infinite void, who does all and cares for none, for none of this world belongs to her."

The young man scoffed, dismissing all this as the insane ramblings of a madman. Yet the old man continued, never stopping, and the young man could not bring himself not to hear it, finding, to his horror, that the frail mocking voice of the old man was searing itself into his brain.

"Then who does this world belong to?" He found himself asking. Yet he had never as much as considered the thought. The old man laughed, and the young man saw in his eye a glint of desperate dementia, of something both human and beast, and something else.

"It belongs to The Thief, who holds the universe she stole away in her infinite, destructive love. And holding The Thief, supporting the mass of the universe on herself, is The Reimu, mistress of all and posessor of none. All respect her, and all love her, and all answer to her, and all fear her, for, you see, she holds the world on her head, over the infinite void."

"But then," the young man's voice asked, independantly of his trapped, terrified and dying soul, "what holds The Reimu?"

And the old man laughed.

"Oh, no... It's Reimus all the way!!"

And the wind blew. And the young man laughed. And the old man laughed.

And in the village, a young boy tore away at his laughing mother's womb with his bare hands, all the while chanting in a demented scream:
<br>"'ri! 'ri! Yu'kuri shee'teh y't'enneh!" 

==Weeaboos==

[[IMAGE:becoming_japanese_for_real.jpg|200x|right]]

FUCK YOU NIGGERS

So my question is, how good are my chances of becoming black for real?

== Weeaboo Girl ==

Wow. Just wow.

One of my friends came over an hour ago and brought his new girlfriend with him.

She was decent looking (not fat or pasty or pimply or wearing a KAWAIILOL shirt) so I greeted her nicely and we all just hung out for a while, talking about this and that.

About thirty minutes after they arrived my two cats wandered into the living room and the girlfriend lets out this scary as hell shriek. At first I thought she was horribly allergic or something, but then she grabbed my friends arm and started babbling about how cute they were and that they'd make SUCH A PERFECT COUPLE IF THEY WERE CATPEOPLE IN HER MANGA and which one she'd make "uke" and "seme" (one is a big gray monster of a cat and the other is a sleek little brown spotty tabby). Well, she said more in a less intelligible way, but that's about what I got from her spiel.

She stopped babbling after a couple minutes and just looked at me, giggling. I stared back for a second and before I could stop myself I said "Get the fuck out." I didn't yell it or anything, but I sounded pretty cold.

The incident ended with her crying and my friend calling me an ass and storming out of my apartment, dragging her along behind him.

Should I be feeling bad right now?

== Japan Fucking Sucks ==

This is something that I just posted on /a/. They told me to repost it here, and I thought it was worth a shot.

I live in Japan, and it fucking sucks. I made a thread about this a lonnnng time ago, but this bears repeating.

1. Anime and manga are more expensive in Japan. The prices are ridiculous, and it's hard for me to justify buying anime even though I feel it's important for fans to make an effort to support the industry.

2. If you are a girl, you will be groped and treated like shit. I have had men grab my ass in public *7* different times in the past year and a half. My Japanese friends say that women should just grit their teeth and bear it, since if you try to do something about it you will be publicly shamed. I also feel dirty and pathetic when these incidents occur.

3. Office culture in Japan is...intense. You are expected to show up at social gatherings even if you do not want to. And at these social gatherings people have the EXACT SAME CONVERSATIONS AGAIN AND AGAIN. I've had like 50 conversations on the power of beer to refresh you after a day's work. You have to say "good morning" every day in a very specific way, and if you don't then someone will approach you and tell you that's not how things are done at company XYZ.

4. The people treat gaijin like shit. Even the ones who try to be nice come across as condescending and rude by American standards. There are also a large number of Japanese men who think gaijin women are sluts and that they can get you to open your legs at the drop of a hat. Fuckers.

I wish all the Japanohiles could actually visit GLORIOUS NIPPON. They'd change their tune.
